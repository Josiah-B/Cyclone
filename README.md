# Cyclone
Webserver based application for monitoring and managing Automatic Personal Weather Stations.

Manages multiple weather station processes and exposes weather data and station configuration via an HTTP RESTful API.

## Notes
This is an incomplete project I last worked on years ago and has been uploaded for archival purposes. As such, some features are only partially implemented. Additionally, general documentation, code structuring and commenting are not up to my current standards.

The routing.go file contains the routing for the API.
